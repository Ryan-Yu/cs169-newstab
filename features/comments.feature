  As a user
  So that I can give my opinion on articles
  I want to be able to post comments

    # This article will have an id of 1
    And the following articles exist:
      | user_id  | url      | title       | content      | initial_comment       |
      | 1        | fake_url | Fake Title  | Fake content | Fake initial comment. |

  And I follow "Sign out"
  And I am on the show page for article "fake_url"
  Then I should see "Some cool comment I want to add"
  # Need to add functionality to this to get this to work.
