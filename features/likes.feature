  As a user
  So that I can help distinguish good articles
  I want to be able to like articles

  Background:
    Given I am signed in
    And the following articles exist:
      | user_id  | url      | title       | content      | initial_comment       |
      | 1        | fake_url | Fake Title  | Fake content | Fake initial comment. |
    And I am on the homepage

@javascript
Scenario: an unauthenticated user cannot like an article
  And I follow "Sign out"
  And I am on the show page for article "fake_url"
  And I follow "Like this article!"
  Then I should see "You need to sign in or sign up before continuing."
